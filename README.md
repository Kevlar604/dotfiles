Dotfiles I use for my new Arch Linux installation (as well as on my Windows setup for some of them, ie mpv). You are free to use them as a reference or use them as-is.

Recommendations for settings to change are always welcome, so feel free to send in a [pull request](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/dotfiles/pulls).

My custom configuration files (like `mpv.conf`) are licensed under MIT, and thus modification and redistribution are allowed. Other third-party files may be subject to their own licenses and may in some instances need to be acquired separately to make full use of my configurations. If a third-party developer wishes for me to remove their code, please contact me on Discord or send in an [issue](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/dotfiles/issues/new) notifying me of that.
